        "Improves Accuracy:\n",
        "Ensures that each feature contributes equally to the clustering process, leading to more meaningful and accurate clusters.\n",

        "Ans)The core parameters in DBSCAN are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Œµ (epsilon):\n",
        "\n",
        "Defines the radius around a point to search for neighboring points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Controls the size of the neighborhood; a larger Œµ leads to larger clusters, while a smaller Œµ may result in many small clusters or noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "MinPts (Minimum Points):\n",
        "\n",
        "The minimum number of points required within the Œµ-radius neighborhood for a point to be considered a core point.\n",
        "\n",
        "Higher MinPts makes clusters denser and can reduce noise; lower MinPts allows sparser clusters but may increase false positives.\n",
        "\n",
        "How they influence clustering:\n",
        "Together, Œµ and MinPts define the density threshold for forming clusters.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans)K-Means++ improves standard K-Means initialization by selecting initial cluster centroids more strategically to speed up convergence and improve clustering quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "How K-Means++ works:\n",
        "First centroid is chosen randomly from the data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each subsequent centroid, it selects a point with probability proportional to the squared distance from the nearest already chosen centroid.\n",

        "Benefits over standard K-Means:\n",
        "Reduces the chances of poor initial centroid placement that can lead to bad local minima.\n",
        "\n",
        "Leads to faster convergence because centroids start closer to optimal positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improves clustering results by producing more consistent and better clusters.\n",

        "Repeatedly merges the two closest clusters based on a chosen distance metric and linkage criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "Continues merging until all points are grouped into a single cluster or until a stopping condition is met (e.g., desired number of clusters).\n",

        "Considers Both Cohesion and Separation:\n",
        "Silhouette measures how close each point is to its own cluster (cohesion) and how far it is from the nearest other cluster (separation). Inertia only measures cohesion (within-cluster variance).\n",

        "\n",
        "Interpretable Range:\n",
        "Silhouette scores range from -1 to 1, where values close to 1 indicate well-clustered points, 0 means overlapping clusters, and negative values indicate misclassification. Inertia has no fixed scale, making it less intuitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Less Sensitive to Scale:\n",
        "Silhouette uses relative distances and is more robust to different scales or densities, whereas inertia can be dominated by cluster size or scale.\n",

        "Negative or low silhouette values can flag poor clustering or misassigned points, which inertia may not reveal clearly.\n",
