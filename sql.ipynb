        "\n",
        "Constraints are rules or restrictions applied to columns in a database table to ensure the validity, accuracy, and reliability of the data being stored. By enforcing these rules, constraints help maintain data integrity and prevent the entry of incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent data into the database. Constraints ensure that the data adheres to predefined rules and maintain the quality of the database over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Constraints Help Maintain Data Integrity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Enforcing Valid Data: Constraints ensure that only valid data (e.g., proper format, valid range) can be inserted into the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "Preventing Duplicates: Constraints such as PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE ensure that no duplicate values are inserted in critical fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "Maintaining Referential Integrity: Constraints like FOREIGN KEY enforce relationships between tables, ensuring that data in related tables remains consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensuring Consistency: Constraints can also ensure that the data is within valid ranges or follows certain conditions (e.g., age must be greater than or equal to 18).\n",
        "\n",
        "Protecting Non-null Data: By ensuring required fields are not left empty, constraints help preserve data completeness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Common Types of Constraints:\n",
        "\n",
        "PRIMARY KEY: Ensures that each row in a table has a unique identifier. The primary key cannot contain NULL values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: CREATE TABLE employees (emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY, emp_name VARCHAR(100));\n",
        "\n",
        "FOREIGN KEY: Ensures that a column (or a set of columns) in one table corresponds to the primary key in another table, maintaining relationships between tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: CREATE TABLE orders (order_id INT, customer_id INT, FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id));\n",
        "\n",
        "UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column are distinct, preventing duplicate entries in the specified column(s).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: CREATE TABLE employees (email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE);\n",
        "\n",
        "CHECK: Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition (e.g., a value within a certain range).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: CREATE TABLE employees (age INT CHECK (age >= 18));\n",
        "\n",
        "NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value, thereby enforcing that the column always contains a valid value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: CREATE TABLE employees (emp_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL);\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3)The NOT NULL constraint is applied to a column to ensure that every record in the table must have a valid value for that column. By enforcing this rule, you guarantee that certain fields (such as name, age, or email) cannot be left empty or undefined. This helps maintain data integrity and ensures that all essential information is provided for each record.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reasons to Apply the NOT NULL Constraint:\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Completeness: Certain fields are critical for the business process or logic, such as user names, order dates, or transaction amounts. Without these values, the data might be incomplete and unusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Accuracy: Preventing NULL values in critical columns ensures that the data being stored is accurate and avoids ambiguities. For example, a person's date_of_birth should always be known, and leaving it NULL would hinder analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Business Logic Enforcement: In many cases, the absence of certain information could break application logic. For instance, if a column represents the status of an order, it should always have a value, preventing NULL from interfering with processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Avoiding Errors in Queries: When performing operations (such as calculations, comparisons, or joins) on columns that cannot be NULL, it eliminates the potential complications of NULL handling. Queries involving NULL values often require additional conditions to handle, which can complicate logic and result in errors or performance overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "Can a Primary Key Contain NULL Values?\n",
        "No, a primary key cannot contain NULL values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Justification:\n",
        "\n",
        "Uniqueness Requirement: A primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table. The primary key constraint guarantees that each value in the primary key column(s) is unique and non-NULL. If a primary key could be NULL, it would violate this uniqueness requirement since multiple NULL values are allowed in a column, which would create ambiguity in identifying rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "NULL Represents Absence of Value: In relational databases, NULL represents the absence of a value, which makes it unsuitable for uniquely identifying rows. A primary key needs to ensure that every row can be reliably referenced and identified by its key value, and allowing NULL would prevent this.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, by definition, primary keys are always NOT NULL and must contain unique values to serve their purpose of uniquely identifying records in a table.\n",
