        "Ans:-An iterable is any object capable of returning its elements one at a time, such as lists, tuples, or strings. It has an __iter__() method that returns an iterator.\n",
        "An iterator is an object representing a stream of data that can be iterated over. It has both __iter__() and __next__() methods.\n",
        "Key Difference:\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterable: Can be looped over (e.g., using a for loop), but does not store an internal state for iteration.\n",
        "Iterator: Keeps track of its current position during iteration and produces the next element on demand using __next__().\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterable:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # A list is an iterable\n",

        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "Ans:-Generators are a special type of iterator that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values one at a time, lazily producing them on demand instead of storing them in memory all at once.\n",
        "Generators are defined using functions and the yield keyword.\n",
        "The yield statement is used to produce a value and pause the function’s state so it can resume later. Lazy Evaluation: Generators produce items only when needed, saving memory.\n",
        "State Retention: The generator retains its state between yield calls.\n",
        "Single Iteration: Generators can be iterated over only once.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "Ans:-Generators produce items lazily, meaning they generate values one at a time on demand instead of storing the entire result in memory. This makes them ideal for working with large datasets or infinite sequences.Since generators do not compute all values upfront, they can provide results faster for the initial iterations and reduce processing time for large computations.Generators maintain their state between yield calls, allowing them to resume execution exactly where they left off. This simplifies managing intermediate states in iterative algorithms.Using yield in generators makes complex iteration logic (like building custom iterators) more concise and readable compared to implementing classes with __iter__ and __next__ methods.\n",

        "pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by the second element\n",
        "print(pairs)  # Output: [(5, 0), (3, 1), (1, 2)]\n",
        "c. For Short and Simple Functions:\n",

        "\n",

        "print(is_even(4))  # Output: True\n",
